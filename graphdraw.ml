(* solve initialize initialize_update render finalize 
         masses constraints scene -- 

   Solves a force-directed graphics problem defined by masses and
   constraints by repeatedly updating forces according to the
   constraints, moving the masses according to those forces, and
   rerendering the scene, until the energy in the system has
   stabilized or it runs out of iterations. It uses various annealing
   tricks as well.

   Callbacks allow things to happen before (initialize) and after
   (finalize) the solution process, as well as at the start of each
   iteration (initialize_update, which receives the number of
   iterations left to go, and should raise an Exit exception if out of
   iterations). A rendering function render is also supplied and
   called each iteration, as well as a final call at the end. A
   boolean flag is passed to render to tell it whether this is the
   final rendering. *)
